pyicalmerge
===========

A video showing how it works: http://vimeo.com/plopesresearch/pyicalmerge

Merges multiple .ics (icalendar) files together and gets them ready for google calendar upload.
Based on https://code.google.com/p/pyicalmerge/ by Pekka JÃ¤rvinen (2010) and modified by Pedro Lopes, because it is a remix I kept the original license (BSD NEW).
